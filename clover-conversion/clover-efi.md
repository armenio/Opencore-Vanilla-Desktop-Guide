# Clover Firmware driver conversion

* Supported version: 0.5.7

**Attention to all users, please note this guide and other khronokernel sites will be shutting down on April 16th, 2020. Reason for this is we've decided to move the guides to a dedicated organization to help simplify the hackintosh process and provide a single, trusted source for hackintosh information. This new organization will be known as [Dortania](https://github.com/dortania).**

Links to the new sites:

* [OpenCore Desktop Guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Desktop-Guide/)
* [Getting Started with ACPI](https://dortania.github.io/Getting-Started-With-ACPI/)
* [GPU Buyers Guide](https://dortania.github.io/GPU-Buyers-Guide/)
* [Wireless Buyers Guide](https://dortania.github.io/Wireless-Buyers-Guide/)
* [Anti-Hackintosh Buyers Guide](https://dortania.github.io/Anti-Hackintosh-Buyers-Guide/)

Main thing to note is that you must specify your kexts and firmware drivers in your config.plist, or else they will not load. All kexts that are currently supported on Clover will work on Opencore, firmware drivers are a bit different.

* ApfsDriverLoader.efi

# AptioMemoryFix

Well before we actually get started on converting the Clover config, we must first talk about converting from AptioMemoryFix. The main thing to note is that it's inside of OpenCore with OpenRuntime being an extension, this means that AptioMemoryFix and that there's also a lot more settings to choose from. Please see the hardware specific sections of the OpenCore guide to know what booter settings your system may require(HEDT like X99 and X299 should look to the closest CPU like Skylake-X should refer to Skylake guide and **read the comments** as they mention specifics for your system).
